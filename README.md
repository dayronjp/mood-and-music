## System Flow

1. **User Interaction:**  
   The user accesses the site and selects their current mood via a straightforward interface.

2. **API Request:**  
   The frontend sends the selected mood to the backend through a RESTful API endpoint.

3. **Music Recommendation:**  
   The backend processes the mood input and queries the Spotify API to retrieve a matching song.

4. **Response Delivery:**  
   A Spotify embed link is returned, enabling the frontend to display an embedded player for music playback.

5. **Playback:**  
   The user listens to the recommended song directly on the website via the embedded Spotify player.

## Deployment & Hosting

- **Frontend:**  
  The static frontend can be deployed on platforms such as **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

- **Backend:**  
  The Node.js backend can be hosted on services like **Railway** or **Render**.

*Note: A database is not required in this initial version since the application solely queries the Spotify API without persisting user data.*

## Spotify API Integration

Mood & Music leverages the Spotify API to obtain music recommendations based on the user's mood. The music is played using an **iframe embed** of the Spotify player, ensuring a seamless listening experience directly within the application.
